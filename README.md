I am a software engineer, passionate about developing good tools and learning the best technologies, and contributing to the community so that progress can be made every day is rewarding. Some technologies that I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, API + Markup), and GraphQL. I have worked for a long time with Backend (Laravel, Php, Python) and Frontend (React, Vue, Javascript, css, Scss). 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Next.js and thus use the Vercel platform for projects.
- 🔭 I am currently working on my business site as a freelancer, <a href="https://www.design4allagency.com/"> Design4All Agency</a>
